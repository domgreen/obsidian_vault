		- DAU - should be easy to estimate
		- MAU - if given this estimate 
		- Usage per DAU
			- e.g. how many people make a post on teh system
		- Scaling factor
			- what is the peak
	- [Capacity Planning & Estimation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-frNQkRz_IU)
		- 5minutes roughly
		- Important for real world
		- Traffic & Storage are the main
		- Bandwidth & Memory
		- Traffic
			- DAU ask the interviewer
			- turn this into requests that need to be servered
			- How would the user typically use the service
			- PasteBin
				- Traffic
					- 10M DAU
					- 10% upload ... 1 request per day
					- This means its read heavy
					- Get the read request as a factor 50:1
					- Get the numbers from per day to per second!!!
					- APPROXIMATE AGGRESSIVELY
				- Storage
					- look at the biggest data only
					- the text that you will be pasting
					- 1M * 10kb
					- use SI notation
					- 10Gb per day
					- What is the retention period? <<<<
					- 5 years if forever keep it to 10 years
					- 5 * 400 = 2k * 10 Gb = 20Tb <<<< use SI
					- then think about replication 3
					- therefore 60Tb storage
				- Bandwidth
					- Read
						- 10 per second * 10kb ~ 100kb per second
					- Write
						- 500 per seond
				- Caching
					- 80-20 rule
					- 20% are popular therefore cached
					- 50M * 2kb = 100Gb
- [x] #wise Design A System [[20240314_Wise_DesignASystem]]
	- Create a local banking exchange (Wise at a small scale)
	-  1M customers 50 transactions per day
	- how do we ensure that if a 5xx happens what do we do?
