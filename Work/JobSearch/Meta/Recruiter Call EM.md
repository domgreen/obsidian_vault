Questions

Introduce Yourself

  

So I’m Dom (pronouns he/him) and currently the CTO at NetspeakGames, a small games studio aiming to make a cozy social online world and leading the technology side of the business, ranging from enabling others to keep a high velocity to building out our backend microservices and looking at what future tech we can leverage.

- Global cross platform services that enable players connect and play together
    
- Built out to eventually be used as a SaaS based platform for other games
    
- Training out the team about best practice and the SDLC
    

  

Before this I worked at Improbalbe helping to build out their version of the metaverse. Also have customer facing experience both at i8e and as a consultant at Microsoft where I helped customers solve complex problems with Azure.

  

I’m looking at a career with Meta to help continue this journey at a much much bigger scale and continue to build communities online.

  
  

Why Work at Meta?

  

- Continue on my journey for building out online connected experience this is where I see Meta with WhatsApp, Instagram and Threads.
    
- I want ot take what I’ve learned at much smaller scale and learn how to apply that to 10x where meta is
    
- Constantly looking to evolve and learn
    

  

Move Fast - increase velocity, removing blockers (velocity)

Long - Term Impact - plan for the future (building out a B2B)

Build Awesome Things - inspiring people to a high quality bar

Live In the Future - early adopters

Be Direct and Respect Colleagues - feedback culture diversie in geography and teams

Meta, Metamates, Me - responsible for success of others

  
  
  

Tell me where you failed ...

  
Okay so when I was working at Improbable as a Platform Engineer I was tasked with cleaning up some of our DNS entries that were stale from old projects so no longer needed.

Not all of this has been moved ot an infrastructure as code approach so needed to do some manual operations within the UI to remove them. When clicking in the UI I had accidently selected the root DNS record rather than that of the individual records. This resulted in huge impact to the running services at Improbable.

  
First thing I did was escalate to a more senior engineer and then look for the last backup of the DNS entries that we had taken. I quickly managed to get the core DNS entries back and then slowly brought back the rest of the system to full health.

  

My learnings from this was to try to make things as simple as possible to do the right thing wether this be IoC or just making sure that it is really clear what will happen and if this is intended.

“Move fast … on stable infrastructure”

  
  

Collaboration Experience

- Cross Team SDLC diversity in different areas adding velocity

  

Working as the CTO of Netspeak it has given me the opportunity to work across a wide range of diverse and talented people including the game engineering team and QA teams. As part of this it was part of my role to help upskill the team and ensure quality both of the product and the engineering practices.  
I worked closely with the GameTeam to ensure that best practices like code reviews were in place bringing them up to what I would expect from the teams and how building with Feature Flags can be a benefit not only for safety of releasing new features but also experimenting in production. I really needed to win over and take into consideration their different backgrounds to ensure they were on the same journey and saw the benefits of these approaches that were new to them.  
This resulted in much better code, shared knowledge and was the basis of our LiveOps system ehre we could run multiple experiments with real users to see how this effected our KPIs.

The QA team was an interesting one as I drove the efforts to bring testing to much earlier in the SDLC than was normal in the games world. Resulting in a reduction of bugs and increased player retention.

  

I learned that part of collaboration with a group of different people is all about bringing them on the journey and not just giving them the answer but helping them see why its important.
