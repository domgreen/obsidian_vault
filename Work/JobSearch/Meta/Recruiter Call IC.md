## Questions

### Introduce Yourself 

So I’m Dom (pronouns he/him) and currently the CTO at NetspeakGames, a small games studio aiming to make a cozy social online world and leading the technology side of the business, ranging from enabling others to keep a high velocity to building out our backend microservices and looking at what future tech we can leverage.

- Global cross platform services that enable players connect and play together
- Built out to eventually be used as a SaaS based platform for other games
- Training out the team about best practice and the SDLC
  
Before this I worked at Improbalbe helping to build out their version of the metaverse. Also have customer facing experience both at i8e and as a consultant at Microsoft where I helped customers solve complex problems with Azure.

I’m looking at a career with Meta to help continue this journey at a much much bigger scale and continue to build communities online.

### Why Work at Meta?
  
- Continue on my journey for building out online connected experience this is where I see Meta with WhatsApp, Instagram and Threads.  
- I want ot take what I’ve learned at much smaller scale and learn how to apply that to 10x where meta is
- Constantly looking to evolve and learn

### Tell me where you failed ...

  
Okay so when I was working at Improbable as a Platform Engineer I was tasked with cleaning up some of our DNS entries that were stale from old projects so no longer needed.

Not all of this has been moved ot an infrastructure as code approach so needed to do some manual operations within the UI to remove them. When clicking in the UI I had accidently selected the root DNS record rather than that of the individual records. This resulted in huge impact to the running services at Improbable.

  
First thing I did was escalate to a more senior engineer and then look for the last backup of the DNS entries that we had taken. I quickly managed to get the core DNS entries back and then slowly brought back the rest of the system to full health.

  

My learnings from this was to try to make things as simple as possible to do the right thing wether this be IoC or just making sure that it is really clear what will happen and if this is intended.

“Move fast … on stable infrastructure”
 
### One of Metas Values

  

Long Term Impact … building a generic platform and services that could be leveraged for any game internally and eventually externally
