```
- global friends API
- retention emails
- matchmaking
- anemic servers
```
- what would i do differently
```
- wait till you need to scale in startups
```
- solution design

```
Break down the problems
- exec summary
- design docs are like news papers
	- exec
	- goals/non-goals
	- how
	- alternatives
```

- technical tradeoffs
	- testing strategy
```

Testing Pyramid
- fast test/slow test/ load test
- make it easy / quick to test

Behaviours not functions

Assertions
```
- technical communication
```
- can be difficult with non-technical people 
- use concepts and words they understand, as they get more comfortable reveal more layers of the onion
- outside of platform we restricted the use of technical terms was often intimidating to others
```
