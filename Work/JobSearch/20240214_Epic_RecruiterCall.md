### Why Work at Epic?

I believe that Epic is making the actual Metaverse that all other companies are trying / tried to achieve and see what it is doing with Fortnite as the leading push to really create a metaverse. Not only that Fortnite is a game that I play myself so would love to be part of the engineering team behind it as well as building the tools for other games to achieve success.
