**What you can expect from the Platform Technical interview:**

During this interview will cover your understanding of core platform engineering topics which are important to us here at Wise. They will be cloud, containers, IaC, CI/CD, Observability.

We will look to cover all sections going in to depth into some of them but not all, there are no right or wrong answers in the interview we want to understand how far your knowledge stretches in different domains so if you don’t know something it’s ok to say that, though we also appreciate when people try to reason around a domain area.
