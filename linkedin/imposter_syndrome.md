This past few weeks I've been hit hard by imposter syndrome!

Imposter syndrome is defined as:


“the persistent inability to believe that one's success is deserved or has been legitimately achieved as a result of one's own efforts or skills.”

This really started when I interviewed with a company I really wanted to work for and got a mental block during their coding question, it was something that ordinarily I would be able to do and have done many times in the past but during that hour window I froze, my mind went blank and something that should have been easy became the hardest problem ever. I completed most of the interview in 20 minutes then sat there in despair for the remaining time moving lines of code around hoping it would fit into place. No surprise that a few days later I was unfortunately told I wouldn’t be progressing to the next stages of the interview loop.

This hit me for a good few days, my mood and ability to do anything disappear, did I just fluke my way into my career? Have I just been pretending all this time? Do I actually know nothing and need to go back to school? Should I even bother applying for more jobs? Many different questions went through my head.

A short time passed and I got back into the prep phase and practised interview coding and again got stumped by an “easy” question, again I spiralled into self doubt and sabotage.

However, after a while I realised that the “tricks'' and patterns that I was hoping to grok were things that come with practice and the techniques that are used to solve some of these questions were originally part of someone's university thesis and only after seeing them once or twice would I be able to effectively use them. I’m not expected to in a 15 minute coding interview come up with some of these ideas from first principles.

With this knowledge and looking back at my career I’ve realised I’m not expected to know everything, this doesn't take away the nagging feeling of being an imposter or the pain of being rejected from a job but does help with moving forward and accepting that things are difficult but can be overcome with practice.

What I’m doing to overcome my feelings of being an imposter:
Allow myself to feel, sit with these feelings and try to understand why I feel this
Realise that “interview questions” and day to day engineering is different
Enjoy that I’m relearning concepts I’ve not looked at for a long time
Look back at my career and what I’ve achieved (and failed at) is due to hard work and not just a fluke
