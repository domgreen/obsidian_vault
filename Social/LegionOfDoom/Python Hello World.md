    - When run will print out “Hello, World!”
- What is a hello World program?
    
    - As mentioned its a simple program that prints “Hello, World!”
    - Its a great first step into any new programming language
    - Teaches the core concepts for working with a languge
    - Allows you to sanity check your setup and make sure anything you write from here will run as expected
    - First appeared in the 1970s in the introduction to the B and then C programming language tutorials, used to show how to run your first programs.
- Lets Code
    
- Python installed
    
    - we first want to check python is installed
    - `python3 --version`
    - if you dont have python installed you can download it here
        - [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Open editor
    
    - write `print("Hello, World!")`
    - save
- Run the program
    
    - `python3 main.py`
- Improve
    
    - `if __name__ == "__main__":`
    - will check that the name of the module/file that is called is named main
    - if so it will run whats inside it
    
    ```python
    if __name__ == "__main__":
    	print("Hello, World!")

    - `print(f'Hello, {person}!')`
- Outro
    
    - As you can see we’ve been able to:
        - Install Python
        - Write our first script
        - run the program
    - This is just the start to our python journey from here we cna make so many more applications
