Everyday is a school day ...

I mentioned in my last post that I had been hit by imposter syndrome after crashing and burning during a coding interview that should have been relatively easy based on my experience.

So I thought I would share how I've started to approach practicing the coding section of interviews.

TL;DR; Practice, practice, practice

Materials

Cracking the Coding Interview

The first source of knowledge is "Cracking the Coding Interview" this is the bible when it comes to reading material for preparing for a coding interview. Easily digestible with increasingly difficult problems to solve.
It offers a great basis to build from and explains some of the core concepts and patterns that will appear when tackling coding interviews.

LeetCode

https://leetcode.com/ is a platform where you can practice questions, get information on topics and take courses to help towards your interview success.

Particularly useful for me is the daily challenges, this picks a new question each day and allows you to keep a streak of completed questions each day which after a number of days you just wont want to break.

NeetCode

https://neetcode.io/ offers a structured way of tackling the questions on Leet Code, linking off to YouTube videos of discussions and solutions for a number of the problems and allows you to visually see which types of Leet Code questions you have or haven't been focusing on.

Solving Questions

When it comes to solving the questions I first layout a high level set of things that I will do this is the same for each question and comes from Cracking the Coding Interview books, just paste this into the top of your solution as a comment and fill it out BEFORE tackling the questions.

I actually solve all the questions locally rather than in the web interface but importantly I TURN OFF all autocompletion and copilot help to ensure I'm not reliant on it during an interview scenario. 

```
Question
<copy question here>
---

- Listen
 <break down the question into key parts>
 
- Example
 <get some examples of the input and outputs>
 
- Brute Force
 <what is the quickest and dirtyest way of solving this, write the rough steps>
 Time - O(n^2)
 Space - O(n)
 
- Optimize
 <can you do better than the above? Write down the rough steps>

  Time - O(n)
  Space - O(1)

- Walk Through
  <Given you now have an idea of how you would solve it well step through and draw out those steps>

- Implement
  <now you can code... remember comments>

- Test
  <Using the above walk through the code you wrote without running it>

- Run
  <Run the code when your happy with the solution, fix bugs etc.>

```


During this time you may (and i definitely did) get stuck at various stages. I decided to set myself a timelimit of 30-45 minutes whereby I would keep trying to solve the question. At that time if I wasn't making progress I would look up a solution on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/@NeetCodeIO has some fantastic videos and will often post the daily problems.

As I watch these I try to listen to the explanation and head back to the code myself before revealing the solution sometimes a nudge in the right direction is all thats needed. 

Don't be disheartened if you have to do this or even watch the coding aspect of the videos often some of the topics and tricks are things that you only really grok after seeing int before.

Checking

When you submit the code even if you didn't have to go and watch the YouTube videos for help I would recommend checking them out anyway these often show either different ways of solving the problem or confirm your understanding, understanding the answer rather than just solving it is key.

Now rinse and repeat, keep solving different types of questions, use NeetCode to show where you might have gaps in your prep.

Relevant Questions

Finding the right questions is often difficult, which questions, what level. It can all be overwhelming with the number of questions which is where Blind75 comes in.

Blind75 is a curated list of questions that you should look at to help maximise exposure to different interview questions whilst preparing. I tend to pick one of these after I've done the daily question.

With all of this it comes with time and practice keep at it and you will see the progress.
